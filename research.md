# Target 7.a
By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology

# Why
- **Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration**: AI-powered platforms can facilitate global collaboration by enabling researchers, scientists, and policymakers from different countries to share data, insights, and best practices in clean energy research and technology. This fosters a collaborative environment for innovation and accelerates the development and deployment of clean energy solutions.

- **Technology Transfer**: AI can play a crucial role in transferring clean energy technologies to developing countries by analyzing data on technology performance, cost-effectiveness, and feasibility. This enables more informed decision-making regarding technology adoption and implementation, helping bridge the technology gap between developed and developing nations.

- **Capacity Building**: AI-based educational tools and training programs can help build capacity in clean energy research and technology among professionals and institutions in developing countries. By providing access to online courses, workshops, and virtual laboratories, AI facilitates skills development and knowledge transfer, empowering local communities to participate in clean energy initiatives.

- **Investment Decision Support**: AI-driven analytics can assist investors and financial institutions in evaluating the feasibility and potential returns of clean energy projects. By analyzing vast amounts of data on energy markets, policy frameworks, and technology trends, AI helps identify investment opportunities and risks, attracting more private and public investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology.

- **Policy Development**: AI can inform evidence-based policymaking by analyzing data on energy consumption patterns, environmental impacts, and regulatory frameworks across different countries. This enables policymakers to design and implement effective policies and incentives to promote clean energy adoption and investment in energy infrastructure.

- **Innovation Acceleration**: AI accelerates the pace of innovation in clean energy technologies by optimizing research and development processes, simulating complex systems, and identifying novel solutions to energy challenges. Through AI-driven research platforms and computational tools, scientists and engineers can explore new materials, designs, and methodologies for advancing renewable energy, energy efficiency, and cleaner fossil-fuel technologies.

- **Risk Mitigation**: AI-powered risk assessment models can help identify and mitigate potential barriers to clean energy deployment, such as technical, financial, and regulatory risks. By analyzing historical data and simulating future scenarios, AI provides insights into the likelihood and impact of various risk factors, enabling stakeholders to develop strategies for managing and mitigating risks associated with clean energy investments and infrastructure projects.
